This is my experimenting platform for improving my skills with Django.
I take my first Django project as a base for this purpose, here is a link for the source: https://github.com/Gr0ki/test_server.git

This README file is an extension for README in a base project. So if you haven't read one,
I would recommend you to check it out first to be able to see the whole picture.
